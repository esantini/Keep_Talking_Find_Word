# Keep_Talking_Find_Word
For the game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes".
  Manual Version 1, Verification Code: 241

For the Password Module, 

Input the 1st column letters as a string: input1('asdfg') This also resets previous filters.

Then input the 3rd and 4th column the same way: input3('asdfg'); input4('asdfg');
Each input will print the possible answers.


# More info:
  Suposedly most cases give you a single answer if you only input the 1st and 4th column.
  
  I think there are 2 cases where you input all 3 columns and the result is 2 posibilities.
